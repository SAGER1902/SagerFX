# SagerFX
SA Special Effects [SAFX] is a pre mod used to provide special effects rendering, which can generate custom particle combinations and trailing rendering methods independent of the original particles. Its custom special effects system comes from the [TG] Techguns and is now undergoing independent maintenance upgrades and high-level updates.
